# Minecraft-Datapack-Tree-Excavation-Serverfriendly-
Chop down whole trees at once with the new lumberjack axe. (Java Edition)

The projekt is still NOT finished but works good in survival.
When spawning everybody gets the manualbook (book.mcfunction) so everything to play schould be clear.

HAVE FUN!

Important files are:
    the craftingitems.mcfunction for all the crafting items(in the chat:/function <game:name>)
    the delete_scores.mcfunction for deleting all scoreboards before deaktivating/deleting the datapack
    the lumberjackaxe.mcfunction for getting the axe
