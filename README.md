# Minecraft-datapack-Tree-Excavation-(Serverfriendly)
Â Having the pack downloaded, up and running, on your singleplayer world or your server, life in survival gets a lot easier. 
 
 Simply crafting the Lumberjack-axe, you are now able to chop down whole trees at once. 
 
 Chop one log of a tree and all the other logs drop down as well.
 
 All the information needed to craft yourself the Lumberjack-axe is contained in the manual you get when starting the world or joining a server. Have Fun!

Important files are:
    the craftingitems_give.mcfunction for all the crafting items ( in the chat: /function game:craftingitems_give.mcfunction),
    the delete_scores.mcfunction for deleting all scoreboards before deaktivating/deleting the datapack,
    and the lumberjackaxe_give.mcfunction for getting the Lumberjack Axe
